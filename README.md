# SwiftCafeAPI
A Server-Side Swift backend for the SwiftCafe food delivery app.
Built using Vapor and a PostgreSQL database.

## Running the API
To run the api, make sure you have a postgresql database instance running.
You can find / set up the credentials for the database in the `configure.swift` 
file in Sources/App/.
Default set up: 
 - Database name: `swiftcafedb`
 - Database username: `admin`
 - Database password: `swiftcafeadmin`

You can also set up the hostname and port number in `configure.swift` 
Build and run the package and connect on port 8090.

Currently I am the sole maintainer of this repo, so I may be slow to add new issues and features;
but you can regularly have a look at the issues/project tabs for new issues or to-dos.
